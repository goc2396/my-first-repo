   <div id="introduction">
     <h2>About Stands</h2> <p>Jojo's abilities depend on the stand it's user has, 
        there are different kinds of stands, <br> some of them 
        can have even more than one <strong>ability</strong></p>

      <h3>Ability Types</h3>
   <div>
       <ul>
       <li>Close Range
         <p>These Stands are known for being able to inflict powerful and/or swift physical attacks with their bodies.<br>
    Typically, a close-range Stand's destructive power and speed rank somewhere between A-C.<br>
     They are also capable of movements requiring a high degree of precision as their User is directly commanding them.<br>
     As a downside, these Stands have to stay within small proximity of their Users, though their own abilities may have a greater range.<br> 
    These Stands will generally obey their users' will.

        The User of a Close-Range Stand generally prefers to confront their opponents directly, <br>
        allowing their Stand's superior might to shine, 
        while also bypassing their short reach. However, most are nearly powerless<br>
         against an opponent who is either out of reach or hidden.<br>
        
        A Stand being a Close-Range Stand doesn't necessarily mean that its ability has a short-range. Some Stands may not be able to <br>
        go far away from their User but have an ability that influences a large zone around them.</p></li>
       <li>Long Distance<p>Also known as a Remote Control Stand, these Stands are defined by a greater-than average range.<br>
         Some Long-Distance Stands are able to go kilometers away from their users, thus they are typically ranked A or B in Range. <br>
         Moreover, the user is able to command their movement with good precision. On the other hand, the remaining link between user and <br>
         Stand means injuring the Stand will damage the user as well and most of these Stands aren't a physical match for other types of Stands.<br>

        Users of Long-Distance Stands will typically exploit their greater range and precision to set up favorable ambushes and kill/injure the<br>
        enemy before they can retaliate. The user may find themselves vulnerable if caught with their Stand far away from them.<br>
        
        A Stand being a Long-Distance Stand doesn't mean its ability has automatically a great range. Some Stands can fly far from their users<br> but still only affect something close with their powers.</p></li>
       <li>Automatic<p>Automatic Stands are all Stands who do not follow their Users' command, but rather, act automatically through preset instructions.<br>
         Most Automatic Stands are, in a way, separated from their Users, and thus harming the Stand will leave the User unscathed and sometimes unaware of their Stand's status.<br>
          However, there are several sub-types of automatic Stands.</p>
          <ul><li>Far-Distance Autopilot Type<p> Stands can travel long distances from their Users without losing power. In addition to their respective abilities, they will have noteworthy physical abilities,<br> 
            such as great resilience. However, most Far-Distance Autopilot Stands<br> 
            follow simple instructions centered around a single datum, like temperature and cannot adapt to the situation nor make precise moves.</p></li>
            <li>Posthumous Stands<p>Are capable of existing long after their User's death, enabling them to act on their own free will. <br>
                Due to their nature, Posthumous Stands are automatic-based and as such, range or damage to their user is irrelevant.<br>
                Other Stands may simply demonstrate automatic abilities, the User needing minimal input. A Stand's ability may be linked to a condition<br>
                 unrelated to the User's will, making it semi-automatic. They could be sentient and act on their own without following their User's orders.<br> 
                 In this case, the User may be unable to control it and possibly become a victim of their own Stand's power.</p></li></ul></li>
       <li>Distance Irrelevant</li>
       <li>Materialized</li>
       <li>Psychological Assult</li>
       <li>Foresight</li>
       <li>Recconnaisance</li>
   </ul> </div>
   <h3>Features</h3>
   <p>Stands are primarily defined by the type of power they possess.<br> 
    In a fight, it is crucial for a Stand User to know the type of the Stand's ability as it uncovers their weaknesses.</p>
